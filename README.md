# Robby the GrandPyBot

This repository contains the Python / JavaScript / HTML 5 / CSS 3 scripts and additionnal files of my  __7th project__ for the __*Python Developer Path* in [*OpenClassrooms*](https://openclassrooms.com/paths/developpeur-se-dapplication-python)__.

This web application is based on the *Flask* Python micro-framework. It also uses *Bootstrap* and *jQuery* JavaScript libraries.

It exploits *Google Maps* and *Media Wiki* API via AJAX requests.

This project was also the occasion for a first approach of *Test Driven Development*.

## The purpose of Robby the GrandPyBot

*Robby the GrandPyBot* is an basic chatbot. He converses in a summary way with user and can give some informations about a location, provided by *Google Maps* and *Wikipedia*.

In fact, you will recognize that *GrandPyBot* is a reformed version of the famous *Robby the Robot* who first appeared in the 1956 sci-fi film [*Forbidden Planet*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7bXuX7x0pg). ;-)

### This app needs a Google API key

This project needs a valid *Google* API key to use the *Geocoding API* and the *Maps JavaScript API*.

The application access to this key as an environment variable in the __/app/tools/credentials.py__ script.
